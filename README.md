# ✨🦊 Angular Platform Cloud 🦄✨

✨🦊 **The server** generates renderer commands and sends them to the browser.

✨🦄 **The browser** processes the DOM events and sends them to the server.

Perhaps am thinking about goals like this:
- lightweight browser bundle (maybe) 
- remote development when the front-end is running on the server
- security frontend when the client does not see the code
- one more example of the Angular Platform
- <<< YOUR GOALS HERE >>>

## Help Wanted

I invite everyone to participate in the development of ✨🦊 **Angular Platform Cloud** 🦄✨. To participate, just stamp the blood [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thekiba_io) or [Telegram](https://t.me/thekiba).

## Development server

Run `npm run serve:dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
